# SRT meeting 2024-06-12

Previously:
https://github.com/haskell/security-advisories/blob/main/meeting-notes/2024-05-29.md

## haskell.org security page

There is now https://www.haskell.org/security/

We still need to configre subdomains so advisories (which was redesigned to be compliant with Haskell Foundation design) index is automatically updated.

## CVSS Version 4

Initial PR to support CVSS Version 4 [#208](https://github.com/haskell/security-advisories/pull/208)

## Fixed git timestamp parsing logic

Switched to UTCTime everywhere to avoid unexpected issues [#201](https://github.com/haskell/security-advisories/pull/201).

## Snapshots to distribute advisories

Gautier worked on [#179](https://github.com/haskell/security-advisories/pull/179) to introduce a new export mode to hsec-sync to help downstream user (without git dependency).

## Ecosystem Workshop

Fraser introduced the SRT at the ZuriHac workshop.

The main issue to tackle is the SBOM (e.g. with SPDX).

## 2024 April-June report

Fraser mostly completed it, we might want to add the slides he has used during ZuriHac Ecosystem Workshop in the repository.

## Advisory database

Additionally, 2 HSEC ID has been reserved for an embargoed vulnerability that we anticipate will be published in Q3.
