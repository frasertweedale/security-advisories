## GHC numeric bugs [#210](https://github.com/haskell/security-advisories/issues/210)

- Tristan will prepare advisory

- For the aarch64 / powerpc issues, these are not base but compiler.
- advisory content would live in `advisories/ghc/compiler`, e.g.
- we need to decide and document the "component" names in the `ghc` namespace
- e.g. `compiler`, `GHCi`, `RTS`
- And we will also need to update our OSV generation code to read the
  files in the `ghc` subdir and generate the correct osv, using the `GHC`
  namespace and the recognised component names.
- We are up to `HSEC-2024-0006` (0004 and 0005 have been reserved)

## Snapshot PR

- Gautier addressed the review comments; Fraser is still
  reviewing the updates.

## GitHub integration

- Gautier will reach out to others who already looked at or
  thought about this.
