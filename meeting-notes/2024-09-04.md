## HSEC-2024-0003 - process fix

- PR [#324](https://github.com/haskell/process/pull/324) published (expect merge and release soon)
- HSEC-2024-0003 advisory update draft PR: [#236](https://github.com/haskell/security-advisories/pull/236)

## *Trusted publishing* for Hackage

- Token workflow
- Hackage supports token authn today, but they are unscoped
- See also PyPI implementation: https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/
  - Project page references the trusted repo
  - GHA uses OIDC to auth to PyPI and get short-lived (minutes) token
  - GHA or publishing workflow uses the token to publish new package version.

## Roadmap of ecosystem security improvements

- Man years of effort are already known :)
- We should write it all down in an disgestible form.
- Might make getting funding easier?
  - Menu / prospectus

### New ideas

- RTS fuzzing (Mihai)
  - or general fuzzing tooling for Haskell programmers

## haskell-security-action (GHA)

- Gautier published draft GHA for detecting security
  issues and bumping bounds (using [cabal-audit](https://github.com/MangoIV/cabal-audit/pull/50))
- GHA draft: https://github.com/blackheaven/haskell-security-action
- Playground: https://github.com/blackheaven/vulnerable-sandbox/ 
- Please review and test!
- Still a lot of work on it: correct file name/line, fix propositions, PR creation, etc.

## Call for volunteers

- Jose's draft is good.
- How many: "around two or three more members"
- Closing date: end of September.
- Fraser will be primary collector of submissions
